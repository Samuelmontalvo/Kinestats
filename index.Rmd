# Introduction

![](https://github.com/Samuelmontalvo/Kinestats/blob/master/Kine.png) 

## Preface

As the study of human movement and performance, Kinesiology is dependent of the 
advances practitioners, coaches, and athletes create through pragmatic and 
objective means using the scientific method. During my Ph.D. studies I often
encounter graduate students and undergraduate students being discouraged of 
the use of statistics due to their complexity and familiarity with the field.
Hence, the primary objective of this book is to provide an easy to follow 
manual on how to applied basic statistics to common Kinesiology problems using
real-data from sports such as Football, Hockey, Soccer, Wushu, Gymnastics, and
Track and Field. 

## Structure of the book

In order to simplify and provide an easy to follow guide, this book will be 
structured as follows. First, data provided has been processed and cleaned up
for easy management, then, a link is provided to the research article or 
peer-review abstract from where this data came or is simulated from. Second, 
the purpose and hypothesis are explained, along with the research design. Third,
a visualization of the data is performed. Fourth, the data is analyzed. Fifth, 
and most importantly, several forms on how to report the findings are 
presented in APA format.
