During my Ph.D.Â studies I often encounter graduate students and undergraduate students being discouraged of the use of statistics due to their complexity and familiarity with the field. Hence, the primary objective of this book is to provide an easy to follow manual on how to applied basic statistics to common Kinesiology problems using real-data from sports such as Football, Hockey, Soccer, Wushu, Gymnastics, and Track and Field. 1.2 Structure of the book In order to simplify and provide an easy to follow guide, this book will be structured as follows. First, data provided has been processed and cleaned up for easy management, then, a link is provided to the research article or peer-review abstract from where this data came or is simulated from. Second, the purpose and hypothesis are explained, along with the research design. Third, a visualization of the data is performed. Fourth, the data is analyzed. Fifth, and most importantly, several forms on how to report the findings are presented in APA format. "],["correlation.html", "Chapter 2 Correlation", " Chapter 2 Correlation Correlation is the relationship (association) between two variables. In sport sciences we can see positive relationships between lean muscle mass and 1-repetition maximum squat, in contrast, there is an inverse relationship, a negative relationship between body fat and vertical jump performance. Below we will look into two data set. The first is an association between percentage of body fat and vertical jump performance, and the second is an association within kinetic parameters of the vertical jump and vertical jump height. library(readxl) Malaysia_Kinestats &lt;- read_excel(&quot;Malaysia_Kinestats.xlsx&quot;) View(Malaysia_Kinestats) attach(Malaysia_Kinestats) ## The following objects are masked from Malaysia_Kinestats (pos = 3): ## ## Avg._Braking_Force, Avg._Braking_Power, Avg._Braking_Velocity, ## Avg._Propulsive_Force, Avg._Propulsive_Power, Avg._Propulsive_Velocity, ## Avg._Relative_Braking_Force, Avg._Relative_Braking_Power, ## Avg._Relative_Propulsive_Force, Avg._Relative_Propulsive_Power, ## Braking_Impulse, Braking_Net_Impulse, Braking_Phase, Braking_Phase_%, ## Braking_RFD, Countermovement_Depth, Flight_Time, ## Force_at_Min_Displacement, ID, Impulse_Ratio, JH, Jump_Momentum, mRSI, ## Peak_Braking_Force, Peak_Braking_Power, Peak_Propulsive_Force, ## Peak_Propulsive_Power, Peak_Relative_Braking_Force, ## Peak_Relative_Braking_Power, Peak_Relative_Propulsive_Force, ## Peak_Relative_Propulsive_Power, Peak_Velocity, Period, Positive_Impulse, ## Positive_Net_Impulse, Propulsive_Impulse, Propulsive_Net_Impulse, ## Propulsive_Phase, Propulsive_Phase_%, Relative_Braking_Impulse, ## Relative_Braking_Net_Impulse, Relative_Propulsive_Impulse, ## Relative_Propulsive_Net_Impulse, RSI, Stiffness, Takeoff_Velocity, ## Time_To_Takeoff, Unweighting_Phase, Unweighting_Phase_% ## The following objects are masked from Malaysia_Kinestats (pos = 4): ## ## Avg._Braking_Force, Avg._Braking_Power, Avg._Braking_Velocity, ## Avg._Propulsive_Force, Avg._Propulsive_Power, Avg._Propulsive_Velocity, ## Avg._Relative_Braking_Force, Avg._Relative_Braking_Power, ## Avg._Relative_Propulsive_Force, Avg._Relative_Propulsive_Power, ## Braking_Impulse, Braking_Net_Impulse, Braking_Phase, Braking_Phase_%, ## Braking_RFD, Countermovement_Depth, Flight_Time, ## Force_at_Min_Displacement, ID, Impulse_Ratio, JH, Jump_Momentum, mRSI, ## Peak_Braking_Force, Peak_Braking_Power, Peak_Propulsive_Force, ## Peak_Propulsive_Power, Peak_Relative_Braking_Force, ## Peak_Relative_Braking_Power, Peak_Relative_Propulsive_Force, ## Peak_Relative_Propulsive_Power, Peak_Velocity, Period, Positive_Impulse, ## Positive_Net_Impulse, Propulsive_Impulse, Propulsive_Net_Impulse, ## Propulsive_Phase, Propulsive_Phase_%, Relative_Braking_Impulse, ## Relative_Braking_Net_Impulse, Relative_Propulsive_Impulse, ## Relative_Propulsive_Net_Impulse, RSI, Stiffness, Takeoff_Velocity, ## Time_To_Takeoff, Unweighting_Phase, Unweighting_Phase_% cor(JH,mRSI) ## [1] 0.8084541 "],["t-test.html", "Chapter 3 T-test", " Chapter 3 T-test "],["analysis-of-variance.html", "Chapter 4 Analysis of Variance", " Chapter 4 Analysis of Variance "],["repeated-measures.html", "Chapter 5 Repeated Measures", " Chapter 5 Repeated Measures "],["sample-size-and-power.html", "Chapter 6 Sample Size and Power", " Chapter 6 Sample Size and Power "]]
