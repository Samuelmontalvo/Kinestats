During my Ph.D.Â studies I often encounter graduate students and undergraduate students being discouraged of the use of statistics due to their complexity and familiarity with the field. Hence, the primary objective of this book is to provide an easy to follow manual on how to applied basic statistics to common Kinesiology problems using real-data from sports such as Football, Hockey, Soccer, Wushu, Gymnastics, and Track and Field. 1.2 Structure of the book In order to simplify and provide an easy to follow guide, this book will be structured as follows. First, data provided has been processed and cleaned up for easy management, then, a link is provided to the research article or peer-review abstract from where this data came or is simulated from. Second, the purpose and hypothesis are explained, along with the research design. Third, a visualization of the data is performed. Fourth, the data is analyzed. Fifth, and most importantly, several forms on how to report the findings are presented in APA format.
