# Introduction


As the study of human movement and performance, Kinesiology is dependent of the 
advances practitioners, coaches, and athletes create through pragmatic and 
objective means using the scientific method. During my Ph.D. studies I often
encounter graduate students and undergraduate students being discouraged of 
the use of statistics due to their complexity and familiarity with the field.
Hence, the primary objective of this book is to provide an easy to follow 
manual on how to applied basic statistics to common Kinesiology problems using
real-data from sports such as Football, Hockey, Soccer, Wushu, Gymnastics, and
Track and Field.
